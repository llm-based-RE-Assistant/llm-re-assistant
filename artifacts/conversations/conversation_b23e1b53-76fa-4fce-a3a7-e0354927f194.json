We're about to start a conversation that will help us gather the requirements for your software project.\n\nBefore we begin, can you tell me a bit about the project? What's its goal and purpose? This will give us some context to work with as we explore the specific needs of the system.\n\n(Also, just so you know, our conversation is confidential, and I'll ensure that all information gathered is accurately documented.)",
