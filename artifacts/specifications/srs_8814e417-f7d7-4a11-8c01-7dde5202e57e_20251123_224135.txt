### 1.2 Scope
The scope of this software system includes main features such as:
	* Task creation and assignment
	* Project scheduling and tracking
	* Resource allocation and management
	* Reporting and analytics

Benefits include improved project visibility, enhanced collaboration, and increased productivity.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
For the purpose of this document, the following terms are used:
	* SRS: Software Requirements Specification
	* FR-X: Functional Requirement X (e.g., FR-1: Task creation and assignment)
	* NFR-Y: Non-Functional Requirement Y (e.g., NFR-1: Performance requirements)

### 1.4 Overview
This document is structured according to the IEEE-830 standard, providing a comprehensive overview of the software system's functional and non-functional requirements.

## 2. OVERALL DESCRIPTION

## 3. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
FR-1: Task creation and assignment
The software system must allow users to create tasks, assign them to team members, and track progress.

FR-2: Project scheduling and tracking
The software system must enable users to schedule projects, set milestones, and track progress in real-time.

FR-3: Resource allocation and management
The software system must allow users to allocate resources (e.g., personnel, equipment) to tasks and projects.

FR-4: Reporting and analytics
The software system must provide users with reporting and analytics capabilities to track project performance and identify areas for improvement.

## 4. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
### 4.1 Performance Requirements
NFR-1: Response time
The software system must respond within 2 seconds to user input.

NFR-2: Data storage capacity
The software system must store a minimum of 1000 tasks and projects without performance degradation.

### 4.2 Security Requirements
NFR-3: Authentication and authorization
The software system must implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure only authorized users access sensitive data.

NFR-4: Data encryption
The software system must encrypt all user data, including task and project information.

### 4.3 Usability Requirements
NFR-5: User interface design
The software system's user interface must be intuitive and easy to navigate for users with varying levels of technical expertise.

NFR-6: Accessibility features
The software system must include accessibility features (e.g., screen reader support) to ensure equal access for all users.

### 4.4 Other Non-Functional Requirements
NFR-7: Integration with existing tools
The software system must integrate seamlessly with existing project management tools and systems.
