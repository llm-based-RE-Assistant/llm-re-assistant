* Sales pipeline tracking (leads, opportunities, etc.)
* Task assignment and reminders for sales team members

Benefits include improved sales performance, enhanced customer engagement, and streamlined business operations.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
For the purpose of this document, the following terms are used:

* CRM: Customer Relationship Management
* SRS: Software Requirements Specification
* FR-X: Functional Requirement X

### 1.4 Overview
This document is structured according to the IEEE-830 standard, covering overall description, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and appendices.

## 2. OVERALL DESCRIPTION
### 2.1 Product Perspective
The software system will be an integral part of the company's sales process, providing a centralized platform for managing customer interactions and tracking sales performance. It will integrate with existing systems to ensure seamless data exchange and minimize manual effort.

### 2.2 Product Functions
The primary functions of the software system are:

* Customer data management: storing and retrieving customer information, including contact details, interaction history, and preferences.
* Sales pipeline tracking: managing leads, opportunities, and sales stages, with automated reminders and notifications for sales team members.
* Task assignment and reminders: assigning tasks to sales team members and sending reminders to ensure timely completion.

### 2.3 User Characteristics
The intended users of the software system are:

* Sales team members: responsible for interacting with customers, managing leads, and tracking sales performance.
* Customer service representatives: handling customer inquiries and providing support.
* Management: overseeing sales performance, identifying areas for improvement, and making data-driven decisions.

### 2.4 Constraints
The following constraints apply to the software system:

* Integration with existing systems (e.g., email clients, CRM tools)
* Limited resources (time, budget, personnel) for development and maintenance
* Compliance with industry regulations (data protection, security)

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
Assumptions made during the requirements gathering process include:

* Existing infrastructure (servers, databases) will be available for integration.
* The sales team will have basic computer skills and familiarity with CRM systems.

Dependencies on external factors include:

* Integration with third-party services (e.g., email providers, payment gateways)
* Compliance with changing industry regulations
