# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION

## 1. INTRODUCTION
### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document outlines the requirements for a software system designed to support project management and collaboration. The intended audience includes developers, stakeholders, and end-users.

### 1.2 Scope
The scope of this project involves developing a web-based application that enables teams to manage projects from initiation to completion. Key features include task assignment, resource allocation, progress tracking, and reporting. Benefits include improved productivity, enhanced collaboration, and better decision-making.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
* Agile: A project management methodology emphasizing flexibility and iterative development.
* API: Application Programming Interface, used for integrating with external services.
* BPMN: Business Process Model and Notation, a standard for modeling business processes.
* CRM: Customer Relationship Management system.

### 1.4 Overview
This document provides an overview of the software requirements, including functional and non-functional requirements. It is organized into five sections: Overall Description, Functional Requirements, Non-Functional Requirements, Appendices, and References.

## 2. OVERALL DESCRIPTION
### 2.1 Product Perspective
The software system will be a web-based application designed to support project management and collaboration. It will integrate with existing CRM systems and provide real-time reporting and analytics.

### 2.2 Product Functions
Major functions of the software include:

* Task assignment and management
* Resource allocation and tracking
* Progress monitoring and reporting
* Collaboration tools (e.g., messaging, file sharing)
* Integration with external services (e.g., API)

### 2.3 User Characteristics
Intended users include project managers, team members, stakeholders, and customers.

* Project managers: responsible for overseeing projects and ensuring timely completion.
* Team members: responsible for completing tasks and contributing to project progress.
* Stakeholders: interested parties who require updates on project status and progress.
* Customers: external clients or end-users of the project's deliverables.

### 2.4 Constraints
Limitations and constraints include:

* Integration with existing CRM systems
* Compatibility with various browsers and devices
* Scalability to support large projects and teams

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
Assumptions made during requirements elicitation include:

* Existing infrastructure (e.g., servers, databases) will be available for use.
* External services (e.g., API) will provide necessary functionality.

Dependencies include:

* Integration with CRM systems
* Availability of necessary infrastructure

## 3. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
FR-1: Task assignment and management:
The software must allow project managers to assign tasks to team members, track progress, and update task status.
FR-2: Resource allocation and tracking:
The software must enable project managers to allocate resources (e.g., personnel, equipment) to tasks and track resource utilization.
FR-3: Progress monitoring and reporting:
The software must provide real-time reporting and analytics on project progress, including task completion rates and resource utilization.
FR-4: Collaboration tools:
The software must include messaging and file-sharing capabilities to facilitate team collaboration.
FR-5: Integration with external services:
The software must integrate with existing CRM systems and provide API access for external services.

## 4. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
### 4.1 Performance Requirements
* Response time: < 2 seconds for most operations
* Throughput: Ability to handle > 100 concurrent users

### 4.2 Security Requirements
* Authentication: Secure login and password management
* Authorization: Role-based access control
* Data encryption: Protect sensitive data (e.g., customer information)

### 4.3 Usability Requirements
* User interface: Intuitive and easy-to-use design
* Accessibility: Compliant with accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1)
* Help documentation: Comprehensive user manual and online support

### 4.4 Other Non-Functional Requirements
* Scalability: Ability to handle large projects and teams
* Compatibility: Support for various browsers, devices, and operating systems
